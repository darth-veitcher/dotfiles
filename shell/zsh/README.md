# zsh
My setup currently utilises:

* [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
  * contents of `~/.zshrc` file
* [spaceship-prompt](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/docs/Troubleshooting.html)
  * modified theme at `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh`
    * as per the [Issue #644](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt/issues/644#issuecomment-508930173)
    * to exclude certain auto-completes (e.g. php) for performance
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) to have commands colorized.
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) to have browser-like autocompletions.
* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) as terminal emulator.
  * contents of the `~/.hyper.js` file
  * [One Dark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-atom-dark) color theme from Atom editor.
  * [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with with ligatures as primary font (16px size).
