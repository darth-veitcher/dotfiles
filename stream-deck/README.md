# Stream Deck

A collection of resources to assist with setting up an [Elgate Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) for non-streamers...

## Backing up and restoring profiles

See this article [Elgato-Stream-Deck-How-to-Back-Up-and-Restore-Profiles](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048424432-Elgato-Stream-Deck-How-to-Back-Up-and-Restore-Profiles-) for how to backup existing profiles and then restore as needed. I have saved my MacOS profiles for now.

## Teams

You can access all of the hotkey shortcuts for Teams through clicking on your username in the corner and then selecting "Keyboard Shortcuts". Additionally there is a full online resource: [Keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/keyboard-shortcuts-for-microsoft-teams-2e8e2a70-e8d8-4a19-949b-4c36dd5292d2?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fMicrosoft-Teams-keyboard-shortcuts-c796cc2e-249a-4ec3-9cd7-00766905aa56&ui=en-US&rs=en-GB&ad=GB)

The main ones to flag (MacOS below):

__Calls__

* Decline call: `Command+Shift+D`
* Toggle mute: `Command+Shift+M`
* Toggle video: `Command+Shift+O`
* Raise or lower your hand: `Command+Shift+K`
* Go to sharing toolbar: `Command+Shift+Space`

## Icon Notes

* The images in a Stream Deck are 144x144px so use these as an icon baseline if needed.
* I have created some [Affinity Designer](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/affinity-designer/id824171161) templates and then combined with [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) to create generic icons where I was missing decent ones.
* Scott Handelman also has an excellent article: [Microsoft Teams Buttons for Stream Deck to Mute, Share, Hang up, and Manage Cameras](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/microsoft-teams-buttons-for-stream-deck-to-mute-share-hang-up-and-manage-cameras)
